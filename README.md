# Tomasulos-Algorithm
1. Three files have been included for demonstration purposes. Homework7_Architecture.txt, Homework7_InstructionList.txt, and Homework7_Long_Script.txt.
2. When the executable is initially ran it will create corresponding directories that these files need to be moved into.
3. Once these files have been moved into their corresponding folders the user can click the Application->Files->Load menu action. Three sequential file browser windows will popup and the user will select these demo files.
4. Once these files have been loaded, select Algorithm->Prerun Check. This just assures that all the needed files have been loaded before the algorithm starts execution.
5. Once the algorithm has succesfully ran it's prerun check, the user can select a run option under Algorithm->Start.
6. The algorithm can be reset using Algorithm->Reset and ran again for subsequent observations.
